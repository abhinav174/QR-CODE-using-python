A simple QR code generator project in Python is an excellent way to explore basic image processing and understand how to encode information in a scannable format. Quick Response, more popularly known as QR codes, is a two-dimensional code or barcode that contains data in the forms of URL, text, or contact information, which can be easily read through devices using a camera, especially smartphones.
The following project grants the ability to create QR codes from any given input through the qrcode library in Python. This would provide a QR code that can also be modified through a change in color and embedding of logos or images on it. Later, the generated QR code can be saved as an image file that can be used afterward for different purposes, such as connecting to websites, sharing information in a fast way, or embedding it into printed materials.
In all, this project gives quite a practical introduction to working with QR code and image processing in Python. Further enhancements could be the creation of a user-friendly graphical interface or even automation of generating multiple QR codes.
